# Food-Find
A chatbot which responds to user requests for various food items by providing them with a list of possible grocery stores they could find those items in the form of links via SMS. The goal of Food Find is to make looking for specific grocery items much easier by removing the need to go to multiple websites just to look for one item. The chatbot uses the Twilio Programmable SMS API and also has a web version which runs on the website linked below. Currently, Food Find can find products within Walmart and Kroger, two of the largest providers of groceries in America. If you want to contribute, please help by writing sripts to get data from more stores to help Food Find become more versatile and useful. You can also contribute by helping improve Food Find's natural language processing which is currently quite simple. 

SETUP:

Text 734-436-3607 with a request (ex: "Where can I get some coffee?") and get results immediately
OR
go to http://1f3a781d.ngrok.io for the web version

A project by Anthony Varkey for the 2020 April Twilio Hackathon

UPDATE: The hackathon has now ended so this project is no longer available. The code still works if you would like to test and deploy the project yourself.
